## Bug Reports

If you've found an issue that causes unintended behavior, please report it to us through a GitHub issue if someone has not already done so. Be sure to include a small example of how we can reproduce the unintended behavior so we can fix it quickly.

## Feature Requests

We will gladly consider feature request and, upon acceptance, implement them or advise you on how to do so and submit a pull request. In either case, please get in touch first through a GitHub issue and we will discuss the feature request.

## User Support
